Pros:
- much easier to use than node based editors (especially for larger conversations)
- scriptable with unity's scripting languages (C#, Unity Script and Boo), i.e. you don't need to learn an additional scripting languages as in some competitor solutions
- integrates well into Unity's look and feel
- it's free (MIT license)

Cons:
- no drag and drop in TreeView, i.e. nodes can't be rearranged
- a single conversation file can't be edited separately by multiple translators at once
- support for predefined languages only (plus three user defined ones)
- not suited for modding
- requires static script methods for Node conditions or actions (you can't supply scene instances!)
- no undo/redo mechanism -> changes will be stored immediately
